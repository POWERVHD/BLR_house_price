## 📌 Overview

This project uses housing data from Bengaluru to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on location, area, number of bathrooms, BHK, and other features.

### Key Highlights:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation
- Neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²
- CLI and notebook support for each step
