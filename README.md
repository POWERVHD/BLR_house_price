# 🏠 BLR House Price Prediction

A machine learning project to predict real estate prices in Bengaluru, India using a fully connected neural network (Deep Learning). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction—all integrated into a reproducible pipeline.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses housing data from Bengaluru to build a regression model that predicts house prices based on location, area, number of bathrooms, BHK, and other features.

### Key Highlights:
- Data cleaning, feature engineering, and transformation
- Neural network model using TensorFlow/Keras
- Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²
- CLI and notebook support for each step

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/POWERVHD/BLR_house_price.git
cd BLR_house_price
````

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat       # Windows
```

3. **Install required packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ⚡ Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py \
  --input data/raw/blr_listings.csv \
  --output data/processed/blr_preprocessed.csv
```

Or open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/00_data_preprocessing.ipynb
```

---

### 2. Model Training

```bash
python src/train.py \
  --data data/processed/blr_preprocessed.csv \
  --epochs 50 \
  --batch-size 32 \
  --output models/blr_model.h5
```

Notebook version:

```
notebooks/10_model_training.ipynb
```

---

### 3. Model Evaluation

```bash
python src/evaluate.py \
  --model models/blr_model.h5 \
  --test-data data/processed/blr_preprocessed.csv
```

---

### 4. Making Predictions

```bash
python src/predict.py \
  --model models/blr_model.h5 \
  --sample '{"area":1200,"location":"Koramangala","bathrooms":2,"size":"2 BHK"}'
```

## 🚀 Model Architecture

* **Input Layer**: Processes pre-engineered features like area, location, size, BHK, etc.
* **Dense Layers**: 2–4 layers, 64–256 neurons each, ReLU activation
* **Dropout**: Regularization with 0.2 dropout rate
* **Output Layer**: Single neuron with linear activation for price prediction

✅ You can customize layers, activations, dropout, optimizers as needed.
